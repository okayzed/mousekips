#SUMMARY
mousekips is a keyboard based mouse controller. you supply a layout to
mousekips that tells it how you want your keys to be arranged and then it
figures out where each key fits onto your screen.

i.e. if the layout is [ "abc", "def", "ghi" ], pressing 'a' will put the mouse
cursor in the top left, b in the center left, c in the bottom left, d in the
top middle, etc...

additionally, one can add movement keys that will adjust the cursor by pressing
'ctrl-key' - it's in the code, it's not really documented yet.

# DEPENDENCIES
it uses python-xlib and pygtk to do this business and may halt your computer
(or make it appear so) - if that happens, switch to a virtual terminal
(Ctrl-Alt-F2) and kill the process. For configuration, gconf is used.

# CONFIGURATION
The easiest way to get setup is to look at setup.sh, change the mappings and
run it.

You'll notice the configuration is stored in gconf, but there's no launch key.
The launch key is set in the window manager to whatever you want it to be -
just assign a global shortcut in Gnome or Compiz (or whatever) to run
mousekips.

To set the layout to qwe,asd,zxc (q is top left and c is bottom right) do:
  gconftool -s --type list --list-type string "/apps/mousekips/layout" "[qwe, asd, zxc]"

Alternatively, you can add/edit these keys by using a graphical gconf editor, like gconf-editor
