mousekips is a keyboard based mouse controller - basically, there is a layout supplied to the program that tells it how you want your keys to be arranged and then it figures out where each key fits onto your screen. 

i.e. if the layout is [ "abc", "def", "ghi" ], pressing 'a' will put the mouse cursor in the top left, b in the center left, c in the bottom left, d in the top middle, etc...

additionally, one can add movement keys that will adjust the cursor by pressing 'ctrl-key' - it's in the code, it's not really documented yet.

it uses python-xlib and pygtk to do this business and may halt your computer (or make it appear so) - if that happens, switch to a virtual terminal (Ctrl-Alt-F2) and kill the process.
